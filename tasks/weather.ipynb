    "## Description of the Tasks\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Task 1: Directory Creation**\n",
    "\n",
    "Using the command line, I created a directory named `data`. Inside this directory, I created two subdirectories named `timestamps` and `weather`.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Commands used:**\n",
    "- `mkdir data`: Created the main `data` directory.\n",
    "- `mkdir data/timestamps data/weather`: Created the `timestamps` and `weather` subdirectories within `data`.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Task 2: Timestamps**\n",
    "\n",
    "Starting from the main folder, I navigated to the `timestamps` directory using the `cd` command. In this folder, I created a file named `now.txt` and appendeded the current date and time to it 10 times using the `date` command with the append operator `>>`.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Commands used:**\n",
    "- `cd data/timestamps`: Changed the directory to `timestamps`.\n",
    "- `date >> now.txt`: Outputted the current date and appends it to `now.txt`.\n",
    "- `more now.txt`: Displayed the contents of `now.txt` to verify the entries.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Task 3: Formatting Timestamps**\n",
    "\n",
    "For this task, I formatted the output of the `date` command using `+\"%Y%m%d_%H%M%S\"` and appended it to a file named `formatted.txt`. I also automated the process using a `for` loop.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Commands used:**\n",
    "- `date +\"%Y%m%d_%H%M%S\" >> formatted.txt`: Formatted the date and appends it to `formatted.txt`.\n",
    "- `for i in {1..10}; do date +\"%Y%m%d_%H%M%S\" >> formatted.txt; done`: Repeated the command 10 times.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Task 4: Creating Timestamped Files**\n",
    "\n",
    "I used the `touch` command combined with the `date` command to create empty files with names in the format `YYYYmmdd_HHMMSS.txt`.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Command used:**\n",
    "- `touch $(date +\"%Y%m%d_%H%M%S\").txt`: Created an empty file named with the current timestamp.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Task 5: Download Today's Weather Data**\n",
    "\n",
    "In this task, I navigated to the `weather` directory and downloaded the weather data for the Athenry weather station using `wget`. Initially, the `wget` command didn't work because it wasn't installed, so I installed it using Homebrew.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Commands used:**\n",
    "- `cd data/weather`: Changed the directory to `weather`.\n",
    "- `brew install wget`: Installed the `wget` tool.\n",
    "- `wget -O weather.json https://prodapi.metweb.ie/observations/athenry/today`: Downloaded the data and saves it as `weather.json`.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Task 6: Timestamping the Data**\n",
    "\n",
    "I modified the `wget` command to save the downloaded weather data with a timestamped filename in the format `YYYYmmdd_HHMMSS.json`.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Command used:**\n",
    "- `wget -O $(date +\"%Y%m%d_%H%M%S\").json https://prodapi.metweb.ie/observations/athenry/today`: Saveed the data with a timestamped name.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Task 7: Automating with a Script**\n",
    "\n",
    "I created a Bash script named `weather.sh` in the root of the repository to automate the process of downloading and timestamping the weather data.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Steps:**\n",
    "1. Created the script using `touch weather.sh`.\n",
    "2. Added the following code to the file `weather.sh`:\n",
    "\n",
    "    ```bash\n",
    "    #!/bin/bash\n",
    "    \n",
    "    # named the directory to save the weather data\n",
    "    WEATHER_DIR=\"data/weather\"\n",
    "    \n",
    "    # Created the directory\n",
    "    mkdir -p \"$WEATHER_DIR\"\n",
    "    \n",
    "    # Generated a timestamped filename in the format YYYYmmdd_HHMMSS.json\n",
    "    TIMESTAMP=$(date +\"%Y%m%d_%H%M%S\")\n",
    "    FILE_NAME=\"$WEATHER_DIR/${TIMESTAMP}.json\"\n",
    "    \n",
    "    # added the URL to download weather data\n",
    "    WEATHER_URL=\"https://prodapi.metweb.ie/observations/athenry/today\"\n",
    "    \n",
    "    # Downloaded the weather data and save it with the timestamped filename\n",
    "    wget -O \"$FILE_NAME\" \"$WEATHER_URL\"\n",
    "    \n",
    "    # Printed confirmation message\n",
    "    echo \"Weather data saved to $FILE_NAME\"\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Made the script executable using `chmod +x weather.sh`.\n",
    "4. Ran the script using `./weather.sh` to test its functionality.\n",
    "\n",
    "The script successfully downloaded the weather data and saved it with a timestamped name in the `data/weather` directory.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook I summarized the steps and commands that I used to complete Tasks 1 to 7, automating the process of working with timestamps and downloading weather data effectively.\n"
