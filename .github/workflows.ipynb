    "# Steps to Set Up and Run the Workflow for Automating Weather Data\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. Create the `.github/workflows/` Folder: \n",
    "In your repository, create a folder called .github/workflows/ (if it doesn't already exist). Inside this folder, create a file called weather-data.yml. This file will define the GitHub Actions workflow.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Steps Taken:\n",
    "- Created the repository in my VS Code editor at the root of your repository with the following path:\n",
    "- - .github/workflows/\n",
    "- Inside the workflows folder, I have created a new file called weather-data.yml and then I have then open the file for editing.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. Run Daily at 10am: \n",
    "Use the schedule event with cron to set the script to run once a day at 10am. Include also the workflow_dispatch event so you can test the workflow.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "To configure the workflow to run daily at 10 AM and include the ability to manually trigger it, in my weather-data.yml file I did the following steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Opened the weather-data.yml file \n",
    "- inputted the following code to define the triggers:\n",
    "\n",
    "\"name: Automate Weather Data\n",
    "\n",
    "on:\n",
    "\n",
    "  schedule:\n",
    "\n",
    "    - cron: '0 10 * * *'\n",
    "\n",
    "  workflow_dispatch:\"\n",
    "  \n",
    "\n",
    "### Explanation: \n",
    "\n",
    "- schedule: used a cron expression (0 10 * * *) to schedule the workflow. This allows to run the workflow daily at 10:00 AM UTC.\n",
    "- workflow_dispatch: to add a button in the Actions tab on GitHub, allowing the manual start of the workflow for testing or troubleshooting.\n",

    "## 3. Use a Linux Virtual Machine In the workflow file, specify that a Ubuntu virtual machine should be used to run the action.\n",
    "\n",
    "To configure the workflow to use a Linux-based virtual machine, specifically an Ubuntu virtual machine, I had to define the runs-on parameter in the workflow. Here's how I modified the weather-data.yml file:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\"jobs:\n",
    "  update-weather-data:\n",
    "    runs-on: ubuntu-latest\"\n",
    "\n",
    "### Explanation of the code:\n",
    "\n",
    "- jobs:\n",
    "Defined a set of instructions (a \"job\") for the workflow to contain the steps that will be executed in the GitHub Actions runner.\n",
    "\n",
    "- runs-on:\n",
    "Specified the operating system (OS) of the runner, ubuntu-latest, to ensure that the job runs on the latest available version of Ubuntu (e.g., Ubuntu 20.04 or later).\n",

    "## 4. Clone the Repository \n",
    "\n",
    "Have the workflow clone your repository.\n",
    "\n",
    "To clone the repository in the workflow, I have used the actions/checkout. This action helped me to check out the code from the repository so the workflow could interact with it (e.g., running scripts, modifying files, etc.).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "I have added a step to clone the repository under the steps section:\n",
    "steps:\n",
    "      Step 1: Checking out the repository\n",
    "      - name: Checkout Repository\n",
    "        uses: actions/checkout@v3\n",
    "\n",
    "I have used steps to create a series of instructions that run sequentially within the job.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then uses: actions/checkout@v3. This action helped me to clone the repository into the working directory and @v3 specified the version of the actions/checkout action.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Why  did I use actions/checkout?\n",
    "\n",
    "To Simplify the process of pulling repository code, automatically handle fetching repository content and ensure that the workflow has access to all necessary files and scripts.\n",

    "## 5. Execute the weather.sh Script\n",
    "\n",
    "To execute the weather.sh script within the workflow, I added a step under the steps section. This step ensured the execution of the script after cloning the repository.\n",
    "\n",
    "Specifically:\n",
    "\n",
    "chmod +x weather.sh:\n",
    "used to ensure that the weather.sh script is executable. \n",
    "\n",
    "./weather.sh:\n",

    "# 6. Commit and Push Changes Back to the Repository \n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, configure the workflow to commit the new weather data and push those changes back to your repository.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "To automatically commit and push changes made by the weather.sh script back to the repository, I have added a step for configuring Git, committing the changes, and pushing them:\n",
    "\n",
    "      \"- name: Commit and Push Changes\n",
    "        run: |\n",

    "         git add .\n",
    "         git commit -m \"Update weather data [automated]\"\n",
    "         git push\n",
    "        env: \n",
    "         GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}\"\n",
    "\n",
    "I have configured the Git User with my personal contacts, to associate my user and email with the commits, although the process is automated\n",
    "\n",
    "Then I have added the commit steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "- git add .: all changes (new files, updates, etc.) for committing.\n",
    "\n",
    "- git commit -m \"Update weather data [automated]\": to commit changes with a descriptive message.\n",
    "\n",
    "- git push: to pushe the commit to the repository.\n",
    "\n",
    "And lastly the authentication:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }} to allow the workflow to push changes securely.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## 7. Test the Workflow Commit and push the workflow to your repository. \n",
    "\n",
    "Check the logs in GitHub to ensure that the weather.sh script runs correctly, that new data is being committed.\n",
    "\n",
    "To start testing the workflow, I have:\n",
    "\n",
    "- added the workflow to the repository, by saving the file\n",
    "\n",
    "- Committed the Workflow File using the Git commands to add, commit, and push the workflow to GitHub.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Verified the Workflow in GitHub:\n",
    "\n",
    "  - went to the repository on GitHub.\n",
    "\n",
    "  - Clicked on the Actions tab to see if the new workflow was listed as Automate Weather Data.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Initially my workflow was not listed there and what I did to troubleshoot was to check that the Workflow file was in the correct location.\n",
    "\n",
    "I immediately realized that the folder structure was wrong and proceeded to modify it according to the project instructions.\n",
    "After having modified it, I have sent the modifications to the GitHub folder with the Git commands and checked under the Actions tab.\n",
    "\n",
    "The workflow finally was there and the first thing that I did was to verify the Workflow Triggers.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this case the triggers are:\n",
    "\n",
    "- A scheduled event (cron): This will only run at the specified time (10 AM UTC daily).\n",
    "\n",
    "- A manual dispatch (workflow_dispatch)\n",
    "\n",
    "So to complete the verification, I have then proceeded with the manual dispatch to see if the workflow was running.\n",
