    "### Steps Taken:\n",
    "- Created the repository in my VS Code editor at the root of your repository with the following path:\n",
    "- - .github/workflows/\n",
    "- Inside the workflows folder, I have created a new file called weather-data.yml and then I have then open the file for editing.\n",
